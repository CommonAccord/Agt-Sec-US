Note=This is collection of top level outlines for a variety of kinds of agreements.  This level establishes the taxonomy of the provisions.  In general, we try to do the following:<ol><li>Have a list of deal points as the first part of the agreement.  This focuses attention in review.<li>Have definitions be at the end.  Definitions should be stable things, mostly drawn from common understandings, a vocabulary shared across many uses and domains.  In practice, definitions and parameters serve the same role, but we suggest making a distinction.<li>We seek to use and establish a common order for the other provisions, particularly "Life" - which we use for provisions regarding the term and termination ("term" has too many meanings and uses), Claim (everything related to disputes), Misc (the provisions often labeled "General").</ol>These can be built up.
